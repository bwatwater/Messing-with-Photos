# Messing-with-Photos
A few pieces of code written for cropping and manipulating photo libraries. Made for making large scanning projects with the family a bit easier to work with.

PhotoCropping: Wrote this code to automatically crop large batches of photos. Found that our scanner added a bunch of whitespace around old family photos. Made it to remove that space. Requires the whitespace to be generally uniform in color.

PhotoShuffle: Just a quick code to shuffle all the photos in a file. Was putting together a Google Photos Slideshow and found that I couldn't shuffle the photos within an album. This worked for just feeding in a library of photos and getting out a new shuffled album.
